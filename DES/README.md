# DES Implementation source code

*DES source code in C from scratch.*    
This repository includes Feistel cipher (round 2) practice code which can make you more familier to DES algorithm before implementing DES.  
After finishing above, now you are ready to get started!


## DES Explaination
 * DES is short for Data Encryption Standard
 * Feistel Cipher 
 * 64bits (8bytes) intput & output
 * 64bits key block = 54bits for enc/dec + 8bits for parity check
 * usually 16 rounds
 * encryption scheme==decryption scheme (only different in round key order)
